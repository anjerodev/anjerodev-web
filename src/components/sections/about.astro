              The First App

              <p>
                It wasn't until my second job at a town hall that I realized I
                wasn't building anything, which is what I really wanted to do.
                So, I thought that if they weren't going to let me build roads,
                buildings, or anything close, I would figure out üß† a way to
                build something myself.
              </p>
              <p>
                That's when I developed my first mobile app using a web builder
                that uses blocks (<span class="italic"
                  >I think it was designed for kids</span
                >). Nevertheless, I managed to build a super basic app for the
                town hall to control some simple internal maintenance tasks.
              </p>
              <p>
                I don't know if they used it at all; if I'm honest, I don't
                think so, but it was enough for me to discover another way to
                build stuff and fill that void. üêõ

              <p>
                After working in the "construction" field for a while, I don't
                know if luck wasn't on my side, but all the work I had to do was
                paperwork‚Äîboring and demotivating paperwork.

                It was time to take <span class="font-bold">another road</span> in
                my life. I embarked on an adventure to improve my English and rethink
                my situation, which led me to travel to the other side of the world,
                New Zealand üõ´ üåè.

              <p>
                While there, I remembered the joy of building that first app, if
                you can call it that. It was after that, with my English now
                improved, that long story short, through self-learning,
                countless tutorials, deep dives into documentation, and
                persistent practice <span class="text-accent"
